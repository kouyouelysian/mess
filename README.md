Multifunctional Extendable Sequencing Solution

## about
MESS stands for Multifunctional Extendable Sequencing Solution, and is a Python program capable of making life easier. A healthy midpoint between RAM-hungry graphical user interface heavy overcomplicated automating solutions and, well, bare EMACS, MESS is a command-line interface (CLI) environment for quick and easy sketching of batch file manipulation scenarios, known as sequences.

Using just the built-in actions, it's possible in under a few minutes to create a sequence that, for example, extracts all .png files last modified later than 2014 from a folder (and all its subfolders recursively), copies them elsewhere, and then crops them all to the same size. Better yet, one can save and reuse this sequence as many times as they like to, on any directory.

MESS is easily extendable with custom actions: simply read the instructions, use the included action template, verify your action is working correctly, and you're good to go!

MESS is made for people who value the clarity of their visual space and the availability of their RAM and runs as a console application. The interface takes inspiration from early home computers, such as the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum, remarkable for their instant result and hands-on appeal. It may be unusual for people used to graphical interfaces, however, a permanent resident of a terminal window will find themselves in their natural habitat. Whichever way you use it - run premade sequences, create your own ones, or even program your own actions - MESS is sure to deliver!~
