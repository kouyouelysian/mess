MESS operates with the two main variables: path and selection. Path is the current working path: most actions will be executed inside it, or relatively to it. For example, the 'sel' command you learned about earlier selects files inside the working path based on a specified condition. Selection is a list of absolute paths to files currently targeted by MESS. Depending on the executed action, these files can be copied, altered, moved, deleted, and so on. Running 'sel' assigns the selected files' absolute paths to the selection as a list. Both path and selection are attributes of the status object. You could treat status as the 'memory' of the MESS environment. Most actions will read and/or manipulate attributes of the status.
